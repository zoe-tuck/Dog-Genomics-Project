Welcome to the Dog Breed Genomics & Disease Project. Created by Kulathinal Lab @ Temple Univerity.

Currently in the works, with the goal to explore questions between the evolutionary genomics of man's best friend and disease. Dog breeds serve as a model to study the intersection of disease phenotype, breed populations, and breed SNP genotype. 

With what we learn while using this approach, we can better understand & innoate ways to prepare, treat, and possible prevent specific disease in dogs, other animals, and eventually humans.
