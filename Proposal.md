# Research Proposal

## 1. Introduction

  #### This project aims to systematically correlate breed-specific disease prevalence with underlying SNP variation across dog populations. Building on prior collaborative efforts, this work addresses key questions in canine disease genetics.  

  #### To achieve these goals, this project will create a database of breed-associated diseases, identify highly differentiated SNPs between breed populations using available genomic datasets, and analyze patterns linking genetic variation to disease phenotypes. By integrating phenotypic and genomic data, this research will clarify the evolutionary and genetic foundations of canine disease and establish an analytical framework that can be extended to human genetic studies. 

## 2. Goal

### The overarching goal of this project is to correlate dog breed specific disease with the corresponding SNP in a population of each dog breed. This is done by breaking down the relationships into three by: curating list of breeds with their afflicting diseases, identifying the differing SNPs between dog breed populations, then finally analyzing the pattern of unique SNPs and the afflicting diseases. Previous collaborators sought to answer the following questions. Can we predict the probability that a particular dog will get a particular disease? What is the genomic architecture of a given disease (oligo vs polygenic)? How ancestral vs derived are dog diseases, and does this reflect their genetic bases?      

## 3. Hypothesis
  #### * H1: Closely related breeds share the same derived mutation and associated diseases 

  #### * H2: Diseases are shared across the diversity of breeds due to ancestral SNPs becoming fixed  

## 4. Specific Aims

  #### Build an alignment of genomes/SNPs across all known breeds of dogs including wolves against a reference genome sequence.  

  #### Map all known disease mutations in dogs to the reference genome sequence  

  #### Correlate known breed-specific diseases to uniquely high SNP frequencies across a given breed.  

  #### Develop platform with visualizations that can be useful for similar problems using the same Illumina Bead Chip technology. 

## 5. Significance

  ### Modern dog breeds have reduced genetic diversity after centuries of due to great artificial selection for specific traits and population bottlenecks. Compared to their wolf ancestor, these evolutionary mechanisms allow for a greater load of genetic mutations. Quite unfortunate, however, this allows for easier identification of SNPs of inherited diseases.  

  ### Many canine diseases naturally behave similarly to human diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disorders, degenerative disorders, and more. Combined with the extensive disease data and growing genomic datasets on dog breeds, a strong analysis of disease phenotype and SNP genotype can be made, with the goal of transferring the methods to humans.
