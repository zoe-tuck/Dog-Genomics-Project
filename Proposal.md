# 1. Introduction

  # 

# 2. Goal

### The overarching goal of this project is to correlate dog breed specific disease with the corresponding SNP in a population od each dog breed. This is done by breaking down the relationships into three by: curating list of breeds with their afflicting diseases, identifying the differing SNPs between dog breed populations, then finally analyzing the pattern of unique SNPs and the afflicting diseases.
